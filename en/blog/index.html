May 20225</h6><h1>Competition in Belgium</h1><p>Our team, BeeGreen, has been building an electric car from scratch for almost two years. Now, on May 25, 2025, our car had its first, but also its last race.<br>Since the competition was in Belgium and we decided to go only by car, we started our journey on May 22nd. We drove with two cars (a minibus and a passenger car) through Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Germany.<br>The competition consisted of two one-hour drives, where the goal was to complete as many laps as possible...<br>In the first race, we managed to hold 11th place out of 50 until almost the end, but a minute before the finish, our batteries ran out, causing us to drop to 25th place.<br>In the second race, our rear tires burst towards the beginning of the drive and could not be replaced, so we continued driving (it was our last race, after all). Of course, the batteries drained quickly while driving like this, and we finished the race 20 minutes before the end. To our own great surprise, we ended up in 19th place! Apparently, we weren't the only ones whose car gave out.<br>It should be mentioned, of course, that in the Belgium racing series, we were the first to have built our car from scratch. One of the organizers said that other teams don't have enough time to do that. This theoretically gave us a big advantage, but in practice, it was our school's first car built from scratch, so it had many flaws.<br>Although we would have expected a higher place, we were satisfied with the competition because, in the end, the important thing was that the car drove and we could at all compete.<br>Next year we will be much wiser and have something to learn from!<br>Thank you to all the sponsors and supporters who helped make this competition possible!<br><img src="/assets/blog/2025.05/1.jpg" alt="trip to belgium"> <img src="/assets/blog/2025.05/2.jpg" alt="trip to belgium"> <img src="/assets/blog/2025.05/3.jpg" alt="trip to belgium"> <img src="/assets/blog/2025.05/4.jpg" alt="trip to belgium"></p></div><div class="blog-post container"><h6>25. November 2024</h6><h1>Introduction Evening for MATIK and VHK Engineering Branch</h1><p>On November 14th, an introduction evening for STEM and the VHK engineering branch took place at the Okasroosikese Castle. The event was attended by several students, parents, university rectors and professors, as well as representatives from various engineering fields. The high school head of studies, Irja Tuus, spoke about the engineering branch, Javier Ortin Cervera focused on introducing STEM and its beginnings, and students and alumni shared their experiences in competitions. The aim of the introduction evening was to find sponsors for the teams, draw attention to the need for engineering in the world, and highlight the importance of students in the future development of engineering.<br>During the evening, it was possible to ride in a car simulator made by the students and to take a look around the basement of the Okasroosikese Castle, where we build cars. In the hall, students presented their engineering projects, including Team Üksjupp with their car, which competed in England this fall.<br><img src="/assets/blog/matik_tutvustus_1.jpg" alt="MATIKu tutvustus"> <img src="/assets/blog/matik_tutvustus_2.jpg" alt="MATIKu tutvustus"> <img src="/assets/blog/matik_tutvustus_3.jpg" alt="MATIKu tutvustus"> <img src="/assets/blog/matik_tutvustus_4.jpg" alt="MATIKu tutvustus"></p></div><div class="blog-post container"><h6>28. October 2024</h6><h1>RC 1Jupp Raced in the Greenpower 2024 Finals for the Second Time</h1><p>RC 1Jupp - consiting of members Henri Johannes Aunin, alumnus Tristjan Lutter, Georg Pärtel Põldmäe, and Laur Vesingi - participated in the Greenpower STEM finals in England under the guidance of teacher Javier Ortin Cervera.<br>After last year's competition, we continued working on the same car. We learned last year that aerodynamics matter, cooling is important, and the gear ratio must be correct for an hour of driving. We started building a new body by trial and error: we made a mold from polystyrene pieces and macroflex, on which we put a glass fiber cloth and a layer of carbon fiber on top - big thanks to Laur Vesing's relatives! We also ordered new gears for a 1:4 ratio. We also installed a computer fan on the engine, which was a risk, as the fan also consumes the car's batteries. That led to the car batteries running out during the competition.<br>After dozens of hours of work, the car was ready the day before being transported to England. On Wednesday morning, we loaded the electric formula onto a van, and Javier, Pärtel, and Tristjan started from Tallinn to reach the ship in Liepaja by evening, which took them to Germany in 24 hours. The autobahn took them to Belgium and then straight to the Calais train station to take the train through the Channel Tunnel to Dover. On the way, they visited an auto museum and got to know different cities and churches (including the magnificent Canterbury Cathedral).<br>By Saturday afternoon, they reached the town of Chichester, where the Goodwood circuit is located and where the Greenpower electric formula finals took place. We passed the technical inspection the first time, and driver Henri and Laur arrived by plane in the evening. The competition took place the next day, and we arrived early at 8 a.m. The car drove smoothly during the test run, and no problems arose. Before the competition, we installed a new steering wheel, which Javier had modeled and 3D printed beforehand.<br>At the beginning of the competition, we immediately passed several cars, but we couldn't catch up with the faster formulas. With each lap, our car drove slower due to the batteries running out because it was heavier, and the fan also consumed energy. We also didn't take into account that the Goodwood circuit is hilly and ascending requires more energy from the engine. At the end of the competition, when there was still half a lap to go, the batteries ran out. Fortunately, we got a slightly better place than last time: 38th out of 44.<br>Despite the fact that the car did not finish, we are satisfied with the appearance of the car (we received many compliments). The experience was worthwhile and we gained numerous new contacts. We also got the opportunity to compete in Belgium. We celebrated at the local Five Guys and then headed home - three by driving and two by plane.<br>A video of the journey can be found <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vhk-greenpower_a-year-of-building-7-days-of-driving-from-activity-7256392729415303169-PqWq?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">on LinkedIn</a><br><img src="/assets/IMG_4850(1).jpg" alt="1Jupp team photo"></p></div><div class="blog-post container"><h6>19. March 2023</h6><h1>England Greenpower Finals Retrospective</h1><p>The Greenpower finals is the culmination of the Greenpower season. The event is held at the Goodwood Motor Circuit, and is the only event in the season where all the teams from across the country come together.<br>It was a huge moment for us, as we worked on it non-stop for the entire September. We were excited to take part in such event and see how our car would perform against the other - I say, much more successful - teams.<br>We managed to finish 32th out of 37th in the F24+ finals and despite the low ranking, we are very satisfied with the results, due to the fact that the car actually managed to finish. There were no preparations done to test how long the car would last. During the beginning of the race, I, the driver, had suspicion that the motor was overheating, but alas it continued on normally. It was probably related to bad wiring.<br>The race inspired us to come up with new ideas for the next season, so much that a new livery is cooking up in the workshop. We can't wait to showcase it fully soon, but meanwhile, keep an eye on 1Jupp social media for car updates.<br>Also, we're looking forward to participate in a race soon (Spain or England), please contact us if you are interested in helping us achieve that. Anyways, here are some pictures of the race.<br><img src="/assets/P2400651.webp" alt="Team laughing"> <img src="/assets/P2400692.webp" alt="Test drive"> <img src="/assets/P2400700.webp" alt="After test drive"> <img src="/assets/P2400722.webp" alt="Lunch"> <img src="/assets/P2400727.webp" alt="Driver readying up for race"> <img src="/assets/P2400730.webp" alt="Team member looking at horizon"> <img src="/assets/P2400737.webp" alt="Tense driver"> <img src="/assets/P2400750.webp" alt="Preparing for Greenpower Finals"> <img src="/assets/P2400763.webp" alt="Greenpower Finals Weiko Kalew car"> <img src="/assets/P2400762.webp" alt="Greenpower Finals Weiko Kalew car"></p></div><div class="blog-post container"><h6>8. December 2023</h6><h1>Preparations and December Activities</h1><p>As December unfolds, children gather 'round the tree!<br>This year, Santa brings car parts and joy beneath our tree! Teams have been working hard since September.</p><h2>About the Teams</h2><p><strong>Team Üks Jupp</strong>, with veterans from last year, ventured to the Greenpower competition in Chichester (UK) in October! They secured a humble position, but the essence of competition lies in self-surpassing, and they did just that! Currently, they're enhancing the car to achieve new heights.<br>Meanwhile, <strong>Team Okas</strong> and <strong>Pink Python</strong> pose as contenders. These two teams, comprising newcomers, are swiftly catching up. External motivation is crucial for self-improvement, and competition is our game ;). Team Okas completed electrical work, and the frame is set to go. Now, they're brainstorming a cover in the Rhino classes!<br><strong>Team Beegreen</strong> progresses at its pace. Team McQueen's work concluded due to the graduation of our 12th graders, but 5 new members joined. Beegreen chose a unique challenge to build the car from scratch! No pre-built frame or guide! They aim for speeds beyond our other teams with the Formula 24+ Kit Cars! Currently, they're crafting a 3D model of the frame in Solidworks and selecting materials (likely stainless steel for the frame and carbon fiber or fiberglass for the cover :O).</p><h2>What Else?</h2><p>Tomorrow, December 9th, marks the VHK &quot;Nigulalaat&quot;, where all members step out of their teams to introduce Arduino Uno usage to visitors. Interested individuals can hop into Team One Piece's car for a simulated drive. The fair is in the cellar of Okasroosikese castle —where our dreams materialize!
