Our team, BeeGreen, has been building an electric car from scratch for almost two years. Now, on May 25, 2025, our car had its first, but also its last race.

Since the competition was in Belgium and we decided to go only by car, we started our journey on May 22nd. We drove with two cars (a minibus and a passenger car) through Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Germany.

The competition consisted of two one-hour drives, where the goal was to complete as many laps as possible...

In the first race, we managed to hold 11th place out of 50 until almost the end, but a minute before the finish, our batteries ran out, causing us to drop to 25th place.

In the second race, our rear tires burst towards the beginning of the drive and could not be replaced, so we continued driving (it was our last race, after all). Of course, the batteries drained quickly while driving like this, and we finished the race 20 minutes before the end. To our own great surprise, we ended up in 19th place! Apparently, we weren't the only ones whose car gave out.

It should be mentioned, of course, that in the Belgium racing series, we were the first to have built our car from scratch. One of the organizers said that other teams don't have enough time to do that. This theoretically gave us a big advantage, but in practice, it was our school's first car built from scratch, so it had many flaws.

Although we would have expected a higher place, we were satisfied with the competition because, in the end, the important thing was that the car drove and we could at all compete.

Next year we will be much wiser and have something to learn from!
